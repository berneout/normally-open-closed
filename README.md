# Normally Open and Normally Closed Licenses

## Permission

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with these license text that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

If you make changes to the licenses, apart from filling out Prohibited Uses or Permitted Uses, you must change the title of the resulting license, as well.

***As far as the law allows, these licenses come as is, without any warranty at all, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the license or its use, for any kind of legal claim.***
